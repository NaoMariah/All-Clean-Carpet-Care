<p>We'll put a happy little bush here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.</p>

<p>What the devil. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.</p>

<p>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>

<p>Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Let the paint work. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Work that paint. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>

<p>With practice comes confidence. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Anything you want to do you can do here. We'll do another happy little painting. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>

<p>Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>

<p>You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>
